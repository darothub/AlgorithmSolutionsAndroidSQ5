//Task
//        A Cartesian coordinate system is a coordinate system that specifies each point uniquely in a plane by a pair of numerical
//        coordinates, which are the signed distances to the point from two fixed perpendicular directed lines,
//        measured in the same unit of length.
//
//        The —Åoordinates of a point in the grid are written as (x, y). Each point in a coordinate system has eight neighboring points.
//        It is provided that the grid step = 1.
//
//        Your task is to write a function that takes a coordinate on the x-axis and y-axis and returns a list of
//        all the neighboring points. Points inside your result list don't have to be sorted--any ordering is valid.
